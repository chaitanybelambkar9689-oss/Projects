Kernel Interface Utility Suite

Technology: C Programming, Linux System Programming, Native System Calls
Project Overview
This project is a custom-built Kernel Interface Utility Suite that programmatically implements major Linux
commands using native system calls.
Instead of relying on existing GNU utilities, we developed our own versions of important commands to understand
their internal working at the OS level.
All commands are enhanced with additional features for improved user interaction and customization.
The executables are integrated into the system path, replacing default utilities for learning purposes, and each
command is uniquely identified with the postfix letter “x” (e.g., lsx, pwdx, cpx).
This project demonstrates deep understanding of Linux internals, system calls, file systems, and process
management.

Key Features
Core Linux Commands Implemented
• pwdx – Print working directory
• lsx – List directory contents
• mkdirx – Create directory
• rmx – Remove files/directories
• cpx – Copy files
• mvx – Move/Rename files
• catx – Display file contents
• touchx – Create empty file
• chmodx – Change file permissions
• statx – Display file metadata
• headx – Display first N lines
• tailx – Display last N lines
• wc x – Word/line/character count


Native System Call Usage
Instead of using library-level functions, this suite is implemented using low-level system calls such as:
• open()
• read()
• write()
• close()
• stat()
• lstat()
• mkdir()
• unlink()
• rmdir()
• chmod()
• fork()
• exec()
• wait()
• opendir()
• readdir()
This provides complete control over file handling, process creation, and directory traversal.

Advanced Custom Features
• Improved error handling and descriptive logging
• Input validation for safer execution
• Additional flags not available in default commands
• Modular code structure
• Standardized argument parsing
• Robust edge-case handling


System-Level Integration
• All executables compiled and placed in system path
• Commands usable directly from terminal
• Postfix naming convention (x)
• Executable permissions properly managed

Architecture Design
• Modular implementation (one command per file)
• Common utility module for shared functions
• System call abstraction where required
• Structured error reporting

Learning Outcomes
• Deep understanding of Linux system calls
• Clear knowledge of how Linux commands actually work internally
• File descriptor management
• Directory handling and inode concepts
• Process creation and execution flow
• Memory and resource management
• Building real system utilities from scratch
• Understanding PATH variable and executable resolution
• Hands-on exposure to OS-level programming
